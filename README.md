This project provides an SQL query to analyze monthly revenue and order volume from a given orders table. The query extracts key metrics such as total revenue and distinct order volume, grouped by year and month.

Prerequisites

orders table with the following columns:

order_date (Date/Datetime): The date when the order was placed

price (Numeric): The price of the ordered item

quantity (Integer): The quantity of the ordered item

order_id (Primary key): The unique identifier for each order

Features
Monthly Revenue Calculation: Calculates total revenue for each month as the sum of price * quantity.

Order Volume: Counts the number of distinct orders for each month using the order_id.

Grouping: Data is grouped by both year and month.

Sorting: Results are sorted by year and month.

Time Period Filtering: Results can be filtered for specific years or time periods.

Output Columns:
year: Year of the order (e.g., 2023).

month: Month of the order (1 to 12).
